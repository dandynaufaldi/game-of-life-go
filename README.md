# Conway's Game of Life

## Problem Description

The Game of Life, also known simply as Life, is a cellular automaton devised by
the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. It is a zero-player game,
meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring
no further input. One interacts with the Game of Life by creating an initial
configuration and observing how it evolves. It is Turing complete and can
simulate a universal constructor or any other Turing machine.
